# Compose and repair presentations

Use this reference when choosing a structure, adapting a template or interpreting
visual feedback. Content and evidence stay with their domain owner. The
[presentation workflow](presentations.md) governs execution and review decisions.
For materially open information encoding, use the optional visual-design handoff
from the skill entry point when available; otherwise preserve accepted content and
report the open choice. This reference places and adapts accepted representations
in a deck; it does not choose competing charts, diagrams, maps, or uncertainty
encodings.

## Place the accepted structure in the deck

| Accepted representation or reading task | Container treatment | Adaptation cue |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Accepted aligned comparison | Keep criteria aligned and comparable | Split criteria across slides before narrowing every column |
| Claim with evidence and qualification | Allocate a clear claim/evidence/source hierarchy | Separate overview from detailed data when their reading densities differ |
| Accepted categorical chart | Create native editable chart objects when required and preserve units, baseline, labels, ordering, and source | Change orientation or slide allocation only when label capacity demands it; do not change the encoding silently |
| Accepted exact-value table | Keep stable headers, units, and row identity | Repeat headers on continuation slides; keep units and row labels together |
| Accepted process or explanatory diagram | Preserve the decided relations in native shapes or an explicitly accepted placed asset | Give each step enough space; arrows must retain the accepted relation semantics |
| Supporting detail | Use an appendix or continuation with a clear link to the claim | Preserve required content even when it leaves the main slide |

Start from the accepted conclusion and representation, then allocate slide space
to its evidence. Choose density for the audience: a spoken briefing needs readable holds
and fewer simultaneous details; a self-contained report needs context and source
information. A title-only slide does not replace an evidence slide.

Apply the shared [forward representation-fidelity protocol](representation-fidelity.md)
to nested placement. Name the active slide safe area, master/layout region,
placeholder or frame, and object-content region rather than treating the slide as
one undifferentiated canvas. Whole-table/chart/diagram placement is separate from
cell, plot, label, or text-frame alignment. Preserve the accepted relation and
table structures while adapting their geometry.

Brand fixes the requested palette, type choices and identity assets. Layout chooses
their application, hierarchy and geometry. A supplied template may provide a
master, placeholders or native charts that must survive; inspect those before
rebuilding anything. Use accepted brand resources as inputs, not decorative
examples from another organization's template.

## Capacity and typography

Measure representative real content in the intended renderer early: the longest
heading, densest table, actual number formats and mixed-script paragraph. Character
counts are only a rough layout budget; fonts, line spacing, glyph widths and
renderer behavior determine fit. Browser measurements do not establish PPTX fit.

Preserve accepted wording and values. Repair overflow by first correcting an
unsuitable representation or irrelevant density, then widening/rebalancing the
layout, wrapping labels, reorienting, separating detail, or adding a continuation.
Edit wording only within the accepted scope. Do not crop paragraphs, hide
qualifiers, rasterize required native objects, or shrink every font to force one
template. In a reused accepted chart, update labels, units, series, axis
bounds and source together; if that would materially change the encoding, return
the decision to visualization design. A template's illustrated values have no
factual authority.

For Chinese and other scripts, choose an admitted font with the required glyphs
and inspect mixed Latin/CJK runs, punctuation and fallback. A declared font name
does not prove that it is installed or was used. Preserve intended RTL direction
and shaping with a suitable producer/renderer; do not reverse character strings.
Neither current example establishes comprehensive RTL support. Embed/distribute
fonts only when their terms and the output format allow it.

## Two editable evidence treatments

The original [evidence brief](../assets/presentation/evidence.json) is consumed by
[native-python.py](../assets/presentation/native-python.py), with the same
[styles](../assets/presentation/styles.json) as the small three-slide example.
Copy those three files into the project and run:

```sh
python -I -B native-python.py evidence.json styles.json paper briefing.pptx
```

In a separate project copy of the brief, change `treatment` to `report`, then run
the same command to a new destination. `briefing` places a native chart and table
beside each other; `report` separates chart and table into distinct pages. Each
accepted note receives a continuation slide. Both retain the same data and wording;
these are different composition choices, not just light/dark palettes.

This resource supports one to six categories with finite numeric values on wide
slides. Long headings/notes still require actual render inspection and project
adaptation. It is a bounded example, not a general document schema or layout
solver. Native chart/table functions are Python-specific; the JS starter remains
a separately useful short-deck option. There is no cross-language feature-parity
requirement.

## Revise the current artifact

| Feedback or defect | Change first | Recheck |
| --- | --- | --- |
| “Too busy” | Choose one dominant message; separate secondary evidence | Content completeness, hierarchy and the new slide sequence |
| “Too plain” | Strengthen hierarchy and meaningful emphasis within the brand | Contrast and reading order; do not invent content or decoration quotas |
| Long title clips | Rebalance title area or split title/context | Real font metrics, body reflow and final native export |
| Global font/theme change | Current source theme or styles where authoritative | All dependent slides, fallback and chart/table labels |
| Local text correction | Targeted native runs/cell/object | Neighbor formatting and affected slide |

Identify the preview revision and slide/object before acting. Prefer the current
project's native identifiers; numeric position alone may be stale after insertion
or reordering. Compare against current source if a user edited it externally.
Never regenerate from an old brief over a supplied, directly modified PPTX.

For vague feedback, state a concrete interpretation and proceed when it is within
scope and reversible. Offer a small comparison or ask when materially different
directions remain. Honor explicit review checkpoints; do not require style voting
for every correction. Preserve accepted choices until relevant feedback changes them.

Use overview renders for sequence/hierarchy and full-size affected slides for
typography. If a cheap preview differs from the final engine, repair the source
against the final export. Source, assets, fonts, engine or geometry changes
invalidate dependent visual evidence. Keep only the before/after material needed
for comparison or recovery; a revert must preserve intervening user edits.
