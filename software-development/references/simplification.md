# Simplification

Use for behavior-preserving reduction after ownership, public API, schema, effects,
compatibility, and architecture are settled. Preserve accepted behavior while
reducing owners, branches, conversions, wrappers, compatibility residue, and
maintenance obligations.

When a reduction includes a migration, use its specialized guide as well. Those
migration guides can also apply directly to a requested migration outside a
behavior-preserving reduction:

- Modules, packages, crates, re-exports, CLI/library ownership, features, or public
  topology: [structural migration](structural-migration.md).
- Dataframes, ML composition, numerical scripts, or reactive notebooks:
  [analytical migration](analytical-migration.md).

Read neither guide for a local self-contained cleanup.

## Reduction loop

1. Freeze status, public behavior, errors, schemas, effects, compatibility,
   representative performance, callers, and canonical commands.
2. Establish characterization/regression evidence and mutation sensitivity for an
   unprotected existing contract.
3. Classify each candidate as a real boundary, transformation, orchestration,
   compatibility mechanism, or relay. Keep a boundary only for independent
   lifecycle, authority, release policy, a reusable pure algorithm, or real
   variation.
4. Try, in order: deletion/no change; standard or platform mechanism; installed
   dependency; direct expression/call; smallest custom owner.
5. Choose one surviving owner and trace definitions, imports, re-exports,
   constructors, serializers, tests, docs, configuration, and effects.
6. Migrate one connected vertical path. Add a bridge only for two named live
   versions/consumers with a concrete removal gate.
7. Move every consumer, then remove obsolete wrappers, aliases, flags, files,
   fixtures, configuration, tests, and docs in the same slice.
8. Search the affected scope for retired paths and names, inspect relevant files,
   compare the accepted contract and measured cost, then return to conformance and
   final verification.

## Hard gates

- The accepted contract is unchanged unless the authorized task names its delta.
- Every removed boundary has one surviving owner and zero consumers.
- A new abstraction has multiple coherent consumers or owns a hard boundary.
- Fewer lines do not justify erased semantics, clever metaprogramming, repeated
  validation, or hidden compatibility.
- Performance claims retain command, data, environment, repetitions, result, and
  noise limits; metric-worse experiments are reverted.
- When reduced size or structure is itself a claimed result, report before/after
  conceptual owners and use line counts by artifact category only when they help
  judge that claim; line count alone is not the result.
- Completion requires no live references to retired paths or names in the affected
  scope, plus fresh focused and project-canonical checks through the main
  development workflow.
